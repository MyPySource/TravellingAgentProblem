# TravellingAgentProblem
Travelling Agent Problem constraints with the capacity that agent can carry in one way. 

<h1>Problem and Solution</h1>
This Problem has multiple constraints to address<br>
1. The time window for deliveries is met.<br>
2. Orders from one area are neatly clubbed together for maximum efficiency.<br>
3. Each boy can carry a maximum of 8 units of medicines.<br>
Create a route plan for the agents (10 agents) for ensuring these deliveries are done on time and that the delivery agents are back to the store by 7 pm.

<b> Breaking down to solution</b><br>
1) Find 10 number of closest points cluster to assign 10 agent to deliver the medicine
2) Find the distance from shop to each delivery points
3) Also find distance matrix to understand possible route available
4) Assign each clustor to each agent with minimum spanning tree 
5) create a dict object to show agent and its route taken
